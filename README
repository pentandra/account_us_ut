trytond_account_us_ut
=====================

The account_us_ut module of the Tryton application platform.

While the primary goal of this module is to provide a useable chart of
accounts that a corporation could use to comply with US GAAP, some effort is
being made to align accounts with the IFRS.

This is a work in progress, so use at your own risk.
